Open a terminal and write: python3 -m http.server 8000

Then open browser and go to: localhost:8000

To CLOSE go back to terminal and hit CTRL C 

Lets say you want to change something
in order to do that we need to save the changes here and push them to github

So we save the file we editted, in this case its this file

Then were going to go to our source control window

And we're going to stage the files we changed, that's the plus button

Then we need to type in a commit message

Then we're going to hit the drop down and do commit and push

And now its on the internet

Be careful what you commit though, anything you commit basically people can see it forever, even if you delete the code later.

There are ways to get around that, but its very hard and very tedious.
